CampusEats is a prototype for a Campus Delivery Service that allows Students and Faculty to place restaurant orders and have it delivered to specific Campus Locations
or their offices/dorms. Through the addition of a rating system, the service seeks to allow people the option to review the restaurant, the delivery, or both.
When fully functional, customers will be able to place an order, which will then be recorded and facilitated by the CampusEats service. Upon receiving the order,
customers may choose whether or not to review their experience. If a rating is left by a customer, that rating is then catalogued by the CampusEats database for 
qualitative analysis of the services delivery drivers and partnered restaurants.
